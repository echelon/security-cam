* Add File->filesize(), and use it to prevent thumbnail generation of
  images with sizes approximately zero.

* Fix the thumbnail image gallery date categorization--everything is out of 
  place.
* Show general statistics (eg 5 new images since last visit), total # images
* Cache thumbnail image gallery results
* Paginate thumbnail image gallery results
* Add a view for the full image with next and previous navigation and date
  display. (Possibly animate sequences.)
* Don't show whole sequence in thumbnail view--maybe only one or two belonging
  to each sequence. Show full sequence thumbnail set below full image view with
  current navigation "cursor"/highlight on the current thumbnail in the sequence

* Make a cron job/script to update the camera clock regularly
* Make a cron job/script to log times when the camera is offline/network
  unavailable.

* In general, make scripts that wrap all of the camera admin functionality

* Application MVC-like architecture
* View/Template system. Perhaps adopt Smarty again?

* Gmail backup account management (prune old images > 1 mo)
