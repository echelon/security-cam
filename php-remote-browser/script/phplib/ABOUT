This library is for wrapping PHP's idiotic library in a more sensible way.
I'll only be adding to this library as needed in any PHP projects I have, and
that's almost never as I usually use Python where possible. 

* File (incomplete)
	* Wraps the filesystem functions
	* Has a directory iterator that returns File objects
	* TODO: Wrap everything in PHP's filesystem function library

* Image (very incomplete)
	* Gets image metadata
	* Generates thumbnails of images
	* TODO: Wrap GD and ImageMagick (and Cairo!! Awesome!)

* TODO (Ideas for future API wrapping)
	* String function wrapping
	* Http layer (Curl, etc)
	* XML/RDF (There's probably a lightweight library for RDF somewhere)
