About the `security-cam` project:

This document serves mostly as a planning document. The project may not evolve 
much if I can't get more hardware.

I recently bought the Linksys WVC54GCA security camera as it was both intriguing 
and on clearance. I have been wanting to put a bunch of cameras up to deter
criminals and pesky neighbors who let their dogs urinate/defecate on the lawn.
Also, it will be fun for determining when mail and packages are delivered while
I am away from home.

Right now, the project is very primative. This only displays a video feed that
is hosted by the camera itself. In the future, I plan to coordinate multiple 
camera feeds via a central server and algorithmically detect motion or more
advanced features. This will entail creating at least two subprojects: 

(1) The central server daemon that monitors/coordinates/manages the cameras, 
hosts any streaming video and images to the outside world, and emails any 
notifications. (I don't have a machine that can fulfill this role right now.)

* I would likely write the bulk of this in Python, and if I do get to the point
  where I write image recognition code, that will be written in a subset of C++.

(2) The (optionally remote) script that displays feeds, images, alerts, etc. to
the browser or cellphone of the owner. This could also allow for remote
management of the cameras. 

* I'm going to write this in PHP since Dreamhost isn't favorable to Python. I 
  may change my mind, however. (PHP isn't too bad...)
